# Border in Electron
A powerful, modern, multi-tab browser, ported to Windows, Mac, and Linux using Electron!

## About Border
Border's website can be found [here](https://onofficiel.github.io/border/).
Border was original desinged by [Kelbaz](https://kodbaz.github.io) ([github here](https://github.com/kodbaz)) as a browser for [Windows 96](https://windows96.net/) (not Windows Nashville! Windows96 is a website that looks and acts like an OS)

I have ported Border to Windows, Mac, and Linux using Electron.
